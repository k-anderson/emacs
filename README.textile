h1. Emacs files

Here are my persnal emacs configuration files that I use for daily work.

The purpose of this README is to document all changes made to the project and be a tutorial for anyone who wants to use it. My files are mostly a copy from http://github.com/alexott/emacs-configs and I only use or change what is useful for me.
